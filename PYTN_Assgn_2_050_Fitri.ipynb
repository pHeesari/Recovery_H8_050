    "## NYC Property Sales Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this projects is to introduce you to practical statistic with Python as concrete and as consistent as possible. Using what you’ve learned; download the NYC Property Sales Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BOROUGH`: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).\n",
    "* `BLOCK`; `LOT`: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.\n",
    "* `BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT` and `BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE`: The type of building at various points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.\n",
    "* This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate a question and derive a statistical hypothesis test to answer the question. You have to demonstrate that you’re able to make decisions using data in a scientific manner. Examples of questions can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is there a difference in unit sold between property built in 1900-2000 and 2001 so on?\n",
    "* Is there a difference in unit sold based on building category?\n",
    "* What can you discover about New York City real estate by looking at a year's worth of raw transaction records? Can you spot trends in the market?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure that you have completed the lesson for this course, namely Python and Practical Statistics which is part of this Program.\n",
